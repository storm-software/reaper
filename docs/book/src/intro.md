Reaper is built using <a href="https://nx.dev/" target="_blank">Nx</a>, a set of
extensible dev tools for monorepos, which helps you develop like Google,
Facebook, and Microsoft. Building on top of Nx, the Open System provides a set
of tools and patterns that help you scale your monorepo to many teams while
keeping the codebase maintainable.
